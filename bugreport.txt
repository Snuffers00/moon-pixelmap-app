//Same error that i received after using update function on write contract. When I broke the website I went back to the same tile coordinates, 
fixed the syntax of my base64 string, and signed the tx. This then allowed me to decode the input data without the  'unable to decode error'. 
The website then functioned as intended. I recreated this error one further time and had the same result.
I'm not too sure what's going on at a deeper level, but am positive this is where you need to look.
